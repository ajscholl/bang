# Bang

Bang is a strict, functional inspired programming language with a static type system.

An implementation and specification will be added here later.

# The name

The name was inspired from the fact that you have to add a ! (bang) to values in Haskell to make them strict. As Bang is strict by default, the whole language is named after these bangs.
